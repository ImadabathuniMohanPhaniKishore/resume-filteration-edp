# Intelligent Resume Shortlisting System - Project Explanation

## A Conversation About The Project

---

**Q: What exactly is this system?**

A: This is an AI-powered resume screening tool that helps recruiters automatically rank job candidates. Instead of manually reading through hundreds of resumes, recruiters can upload all resumes at once along with a job description, and the system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to calculate how well each candidate matches the position.

---

**Q: How does it work from a user's perspective?**

A: Very simple workflow:

1. **Sign up/Login** - Recruiters create an account or sign in
2. **Upload resumes** - Drop multiple resume files (TXT, PDF, DOC, DOCX)
3. **Paste job description** - Add the job title and full job description
4. **Click "Start Analysis"** - The system processes everything
5. **View ranked results** - See candidates sorted by match percentage
6. **Export results** - Download a CSV file with all candidates and scores

The entire process takes just a few minutes, even with dozens of resumes.

---

**Q: What technology makes this "intelligent"?**

A: The system uses several NLP techniques:

**1. Text Extraction & Cleaning**
- Extracts text from uploaded documents
- Removes special characters and normalizes spacing
- Identifies key information like names and emails

**2. Skill Recognition**
- Scans resumes for 50+ common technical and soft skills
- Matches skills like "Python", "React", "Machine Learning", "Leadership"
- Creates a skill profile for each candidate

**3. TF-IDF Vectorization**
- Converts text documents into mathematical vectors
- TF (Term Frequency): How often a word appears in a document
- IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): How unique/important a word is across all documents
- This makes "React" in a developer job more valuable than common words like "the" or "and"

**4. Cosine Similarity**
- Measures the angle between job description vector and resume vector
- Score of 100% = perfect match
- Score of 0% = no similarity
- Accounts for both keyword overlap and contextual relevance

**5. Keyword Matching**
- Identifies specific terms that appear in both job description and resume
- Highlights the strongest matching keywords
- Helps recruiters understand WHY a candidate scored well

---

**Q: Can you break down the technical architecture?**

A: Sure! The system has three main layers:

### **Frontend (React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS)**

**Components:**
- `AuthForm.tsx` - Handles user registration and login
- `Dashboard.tsx` - Main interface with navigation and state management
- `FileUpload.tsx` - Manages file uploads, job description input, and processing flow
- `ResultsDisplay.tsx` - Shows ranked candidates with scores, skills, and export options

**Context:**
- `AuthContext.tsx` - Manages authentication state across the app

**Features:**
- Real-time progress bar during processing
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Animated transitions and loading states
- CSV export functionality

### **Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)**

**Three serverless functions:**

1. **process-resume** (`/functions/v1/process-resume`)
   - Receives resume text content
   - Extracts candidate name (usually first line)
   - Extracts email using regex pattern
   - Identifies skills from predefined skill list
   - Stores resume data in database
   - Returns extracted metadata

2. **process-job-description** (`/functions/v1/process-job-description`)
   - Receives job title and description
   - Extracts requirements section if present
   - Stores job posting in database
   - Returns job posting ID for matching

3. **calculate-similarity** (`/functions/v1/calculate-similarity`)
   - Fetches job posting and all resumes
   - Tokenizes text (converts to lowercase words)
   - Calculates TF-IDF vectors for all documents
   - Computes cosine similarity between job and each resume
   - Identifies matched keywords
   - Ranks candidates by score
   - Stores results in database
   - Returns ranked list

### **Database (Supabase PostgreSQL)**

**Three main tables:**

1. **job_postings**
   - id, title, description, requirements
   - created_by (links to user)
   - created_at, status

2. **resumes**
   - id, filename, candidate_name, candidate_email
   - extracted_text, skills (array)
   - uploaded_at, uploaded_by

3. **similarity_results**
   - id, job_posting_id, resume_id
   - similarity_score (0-100)
   - matched_keywords (array)
   - ranking, calculated_at

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Authenticated users only

---

**Q: How accurate is the matching algorithm?**

A: The TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity approach is quite effective:

**Strengths:**
- Captures keyword relevance (e.g., "Python" in a Python job)
- Considers word frequency and rarity
- Fast processing (handles 50+ resumes in seconds)
- No training data needed
- Language agnostic

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't understand deep semantics (e.g., "ML engineer" vs "Machine Learning engineer" might not match perfectly)
- Can't detect lies or exaggerations
- Keyword stuffing could artificially boost scores
- Doesn't consider years of experience or education level

**Real-world performance:**
- High matches (70%+): Usually strong candidates worth interviewing
- Medium matches (50-70%): Potential fits, worth reviewing
- Low matches (<50%): Likely not a good fit for the role

---

**Q: Walk me through the data flow with an example**

A: Let's say a recruiter is hiring a "Senior Frontend Developer":

**Step 1: Job Description Processing**
```
Input: "Senior Frontend Developer - Must have 5+ years React, TypeScript,
        Redux experience. Strong CSS skills required..."

Processing:
- Store in job_postings table
- Extract key requirements
- Generate job_posting_id: "abc-123"
```

**Step 2: Resume Processing**
```
Resume 1: "John Doe, john@email.com
           Senior Software Engineer with 6 years React, TypeScript, Redux..."

Extraction:
- Name: "John Doe"
- Email: "john@email.com"
- Skills: ["react", "typescript", "redux", "javascript"]
- Store as resume_id: "xyz-456"

Resume 2: "Jane Smith, jane@email.com
           Python Developer with Django, Flask, PostgreSQL..."

Extraction:
- Name: "Jane Smith"
- Email: "jane@email.com"
- Skills: ["python", "django", "flask", "postgresql"]
- Store as resume_id: "xyz-789"
```

**Step 3: Similarity Calculation**
```
Job tokens: [senior, frontend, developer, years, react, typescript, redux,
             experience, strong, css, skills, required...]

John's resume tokens: [john, doe, senior, software, engineer, years, react,
                       typescript, redux, javascript...]

Jane's resume tokens: [jane, smith, python, developer, django, flask,
                       postgresql, backend...]

TF-IDF Calculation:
- "react" appears in job and John's resume → high relevance
- "typescript" appears in job and John's resume → high relevance
- "python" appears only in Jane's resume → low relevance for this job

Cosine Similarity:
- John vs Job: 0.78 → 78% match
- Jane vs Job: 0.23 → 23% match

Matched Keywords:
- John: ["react", "typescript", "redux", "senior", "developer", "experience"]
- Jane: ["developer", "experience"]

Final Ranking:
1. John Doe - 78% match
2. Jane Smith - 23% match
```

**Step 4: Display Results**
```
Results page shows:
- John ranked #1 with 78% (green badge - strong match)
- Skills shown: React, TypeScript, Redux, JavaScript
- Matched keywords highlighted
- Email link to contact John
```

- Comply with GDPR/CCPA
- Candidates should be informed about automated screening

**Transparency:**
- Explain to candidates that AI screening is used
- Allow appeals or human review requests
- Don't use scores as the sole decision maker

**Best Practice:**
Use this system for initial filtering, but always have human recruiters review shortlisted candidates before making final decisions.
